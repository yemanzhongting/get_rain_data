This station history list is now deprecated.  Please refer to the new 
station list found here:

        ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv

The new list is based on more current information and will be updated 
regularly.  If you do not see your station listed by its name, please 
look for it using the USAF Station ID, or the WBAN number, and the 
Latitude and Longitude.  Station names will change from time to time 
but these IDs and their corresponding Lat/Lons are more reliable.

If you have questions about this change, please contact us using info 
found here:
